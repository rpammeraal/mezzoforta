4/26

-	Support for Postgres/songbase databases.
-	Header w/ dropdown for postgresql schemas (find out way to refresh views)
-	Refactoring of classes, subclassing of QSqlQueryModel to prepare for drag & drop
-	based on selected cell in song, sbid should be populated accordingly -- if record is selected, only populate record_id

5/16:
-	created all detail screens for all entities except charts
-	refactor SBModel* classes almost complete
-	status bar
-	SBID class simplified -- in future subclass all non-essential stuff to SBIDExtended
-	initial support for album artwork and loading performer home page

<for next demo>
-	redo playlist/genre tab to tree structure
-	revamp search functionality
-	fix context menu

<future>
-	Drag & drop

-	context menu fails

todo:
-	QCompleter needs to be made context sensitive of playlist or genre selected.
-	cancel on open db when no db is found at runtime.
-	if genre changed, try to select genre that was changed (much later).
