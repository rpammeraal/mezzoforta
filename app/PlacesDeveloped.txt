	-	SBIDPerformance should have smart pointers for performer, album (song already exist). These pointers should be
	    initialized upon calling a method that relies on the pointer being populated. Eg.: SBIDPerformance::songPerformerName()
		should test if _performerPtr is set. If not, look up, and retrieve performerName from _performerPtr.

20161106:
-	All Songs -> War -> Back (All Songs) -> 40: no albums
-	Many methods in SBIDBase made pure virtual.

20161107:
-	migrated majority of SBIDBase::attributes to the relevant subclasses.
-	In all SBID* classes: make sure that attributes are properly copy constructed.
-	Consider caching of entire database:
    -	Subclasses of SBID, pretty much all of DataEntity classes can go in subclasses of SBID
	-	At that point, we can tell to a SBID instance: throw yourself in the queue, play yourself, etc.

20161110:
-	Added progress dialog when playlist is loaded.
-	Updating MBID() for performers fixed().
    -	Playlist:Moose!Music/Playlist:Il venti d'azzuro/Album:I'l venti d'azzrirp/Song:Visitors/Performer:Koto
	-	Directly look up Performer:Koto
-	bug with SBIDManagerTemplate fixed -- executeBatch called multiple times. SBIDBase::isSaved() is called after each object has been updated in the database.
-	all navigation tested
-	test search

20161112:
-	Milestone -- reorg SBID.h into parent- and childclasses. Effort started at 6/29/2016.
    -	SBIDBase: attributes pushed down to subclasses
	-	All SBIDBase items are properly cached and used from cache
-	investigate if all fields at the SBIDBase can be removed and delegated to the subclasses
-	SBIDPerformer: need to load album directly associated with performer. Include this in ::albums().
-	progress bar SBIDPerformer::_loadPerformances
-	all _load* methods in SBID* classes must do a clear() on its data structure
-	Add open_flag to retrieveSet.
-	No SBID* class should create SBSqlQueryModel, except static methods. This should be replaced with SBTableModel.

20161114:
-	test play now/enqueue -- using SBIDBase*::key() throughout all views
    -	All Songs/Play U2/Popmuzik does not get played -- without warning: test added to check for path length > 0
-	Modified SBDIalogSelectItem to incorporate keys
-	test music player including play keys

20161115:
-	De Heer Klassiekers playlist: empty items: added SBIDSongPtr as item to playlist
        -	Trista Pena is skipped -- bug in retrieve path when retrieving performance
-	Escape key from lyrics tab does not work: unable to reproduce

20161117:
-	temporary checkin
-	SBIDPlaylist: _loadItems -> replaced with refreshDependents. Need to make sure each call
    uses the correct showProgressDialogFlag
-	drag/drop to playlists works
    -	need to check for dups
	-	creating/removing playlists works

20161118:
-	Julie/Levellers: exists in 1989 and Empty year playlists. Only Empty Year shows up in song page.
-	test drag/drop to playlists
    -	drag/drop from other playlist contents breaks
	-	test remove item from playlist
-	player skips every other song: not reproducable
    -	drag/drop: use key() instead of dragging/dropping entire SBIDBase instances.
-	no performer logos retrieved: echonest is offline (20161115). Now using wikimedia commons.
-	Assign playlist to another playlist: crash

20161119:
-	Streamlined:
    -	SBIDAlbum: _albumPerformerName removed.
	-	SBIDPerformance: _isOriginalPerformerFlag removed.
-	SBTab::refreshTabIfCurrent(const SBIDBase& id): convert parameter to SBIDPtr

20161121:
-	Belgica: The Memories: does not display all songs (compare with songbase(www): not reproducable
-	Duration field op songtab not properly populate: not reproducable
-	If switched to different database -- clear all SBIDManagers
-	U2/Albums: year released = 0
-	Too many 'Retrieving'-dialog boxes when playing radio
-	Using Preloader for retrieving album performances
-	need to see duration and number of songs on album page

20161201 - Happy Birthday Emily! - initial import works: one performer albums with either new or existing songs.
-	Split up SBIDPerformance into SongSBIDPerformance and SBIDRecordPerformance, which inherits the former
-	Can we get rid of itemID()? No!
-	updateSQL() should reset changedFlag. Done thru SBIDManager, calls clearChangedFlag after commit().
-	SBIDSong::updateSQL(): model like SBIDAlbum::updateSQL()
-	Create database restore point.
-	Playing flac files is not robust -- init() did not initialize all variables. Fixed.
-	Incomplete Belgica: The Memories, following this sequence
    0 ScreenItem:AllSongs :subtabID=2147483647 :sortColumn=2147483647 :editFlag=false subtabID= 2147483647 isEditFlag: false sortColumn: 2147483647

	Preloader would only load items that were not previously in cache. Fixed.
-	Go to Exodus/Bob Marley record. Alt click logo start play. Plays different Bob Marley album. Not a bug. Correct album starts playing. Smoke something different next time.
-	Search Exodus/Bob Marley record. Clock One Love/People Get Ready. Too many things gets cached.
- 	search Me And Julio Down The Schoolyard, alt click song logo to play. Crash. SBAlbumPerformance tried to load unexisting albumPerformances. Fixed.

20161204:
-	Melissa Etheridge: 0 songs. Fixed.
-	Set default on showProgressBarFlag to 0, modify parameter where needed.
-	ignore files with unknown extension
-	After search, search field does not get cleared.

20161208:
-	Initial wizard done.

20161214:
-	Dialog to proceed to import of music files
-	SBIDAlbum::retrieveUnknownAlbum(), SBIDPerformer::retrieveVariousArtists() should use ::find
    -	Create config table entry to identify VARIOUS ARTISTS record and unknownAlbum record
-	Songduration in album views is off.
-	Too many progress bars displayed
-	Use unknown album if album can't be determined: not needed, will take name of parent directory

20161216:
-	Import on startup: logo needs to disappear.
-	List all files that did not get imported.
-	ask if music directory is organized like <performer>/<album>. If not, always take album title from meta data. If yes, only take album meta data if not exist. Make this configurable.

Between 20161215 and 20170604:
-	SBIDAlbum
-		Contains: list of SBIDAlbumPerformance. As many as there are on the album.
-			SBIDAlbumPerformances: contains list of 0,1 or more SBIDOnlinePerformances. One of them is the preferred one (usually the first one added).
-	classes can implement a method that depends on a lower class. Eg.: AlbumPerformance.path() returns the preferred OnlinePerformance.path()
<immediate to do>
-	make everything compile:
	V	create album performances out of online performances
	V	add preferred flag to online performance in database
	V	instantiate OnlinePerformance should populate attributes of superclasses (e.g. AlbumPerformance).
-	check retrieveSQL fields with instantiate fields
-	check key method: should now be 1 integer -- maybe get rid of key replace with int
-	check Preloader assignments
-	take template in SBIDSongPerformance to load dependent pointers: _performerPtr(), _loadPerformerPtr(). 
-	refreshDependents: take forcedFlag into account (see SBIDSong).
-	find out why UB40 & CHrissie Hynde show up as performers for "40".
-	song table has onlinePerformanceID. May need to create one on the album_performance table, in case there are multiple song files for the
    same song.
-	playlist performances not loading
-	enqueueing performer not working
-	Duplicate song entries in 'All Songs'
-	<schema>.playlist can only contain record_performance_id. This should be changed to online_performance_id. code in Preloader::playlistItems() reflects this.
-	SBIDPerformer::songs(): now using __albumPerformances, which gets derived/populated from
    _onlinePerformances. Better to use _onlinePerformances in the call to tm->populateSongsByPerformer.
-	SongDetail: main performer in bold. Example: Happy Xmas (War Is Over)
-	Click Radio. Shuffle. Song #1 is gone.
-	add duration to album tab

20170604:
-	enqueuing playlist Moose!Music not fully working.
    -	load reggae playlist. not recursive -- songs from Cafe Jamaica/Reggae 12" are not loaded

20170607:

    -	playlist only to support SBIDOnlinePerformance as song

20170701:
-	Charts implemented.
-	Definitions in SBIDSongPerformance.h to be moved to SBID.h
-	Love is a battlefield:
	-	shows ", Pat Benatar" note the comma at the start.
	-	unknown year. If year is unknown, possibly actively set from earliest chart date - not a bug.
-	All SBID* classes: redirector methods to rely directly on Mgrs -- do not store
	any smart pointer in any SBID* class, just the actual ID.
-	All SBID* classes: _init() to initialize all attributes and be called.
-	All SBID* classes: operator =() to be implemented
-	Bohemian Rhapsody opened from chart -- blank album titles.
-	Playlist 'Herinneringen Aan Holland' -- many blank album titles.
-	unable to play on windows
-	enqueueing from chart is slow (windows)

20170703:
-	charts tab (performer, song): to be ordered by chart position.

20170704:
-	search screen:
	-	search for following items in this order, goes into loop.

-	Importing album for single performer gets more stable
-	Properties to write defaults if they don't exists
    -	Database table cleaned up
-	character after ' is capitalized in import.

-	Album edit works again
-	Fixed bug in song import that would not lookup existing song correctly.

20171207:
-	Initial dev effort on edit song.

20171211: Booyah! (courtesy of Susan Aiken - Live Below Zero).
-	Need to restructure caches:
    -	need to create a cachemanager.
	-	individual commits needs to be moved to what is now commitAll
	-	transaction based database update
-	edit performer now works.

20171212:
-	edit album works.
-	restructured edit album/edit performer to look like eachother

20171213:
-	edit song works.

20171214:
-	Need to restructure caches:
    -	need to create a cachemanager.
	-	each SBIDObject needs to have a pointer to its manager
	-	individual commits needs to be moved to what is now commitAll
-	examine all dynamic_casts
-	Open any artist, mismatch on opened song.

CURRENT:
*	Edit song, different song shows up.
*	find a common way to match strings:
    SBIDSong uses Common::simplified
	MusicLibrary uses removeNonAlphaNumericIncludingSpaces -- combine both strategies and put in simplified
	save method in SBTabAlbumEdit, SBTabPerformerEdit, SBTabSongEdit use different ways to find out if title/name/etc has changed
*	when schema is changed, search (et al) is not updated
*	test ability to assign to playlist from all screens
*	test ability to play from all screens
*	See if SBIDBase ctors can be made private
*	Add dialogbox to save operations.
*	Preload all caches
    *	AllSongs tab to not use SQL
	*	SearchItem to not use SQL

Bugs that need to be fixed:
*	Assign: song The Wind Cries Mary: does not ask for version -- should ask for version/performer from song page
*	Assignment of songs from another playlist does not work:  Assign If God Will Send His Angeles/Heverlee Lommel to Herinneringen aan Holland.
*	Search for Limburg/Rowwen Heze: Does not play
*	Search for Hear That Sound/INXS Heze: Does not play
*	New Gold Dream/Simple Minds: click to play, does not play album songs.
*	Drag song from 'songs in queue' after shuffle -- incorrect song dragged
* 	After import, show in status bar (bottom) how many songs where imported.
*	If performer name missing and library is set up as performer/album/songs, take performer name from directory structure.
* 	Show window with songs to be imported.
*	Weird stuff happens when an item is removed from 'Songs In Queue'.
*	Rene Froger, Winter In America in songlist shows year as 1978. Should be 1988.

Enhancements:
*	SBIDPlaylist::_getAllItemsByPlaylistRecursive: need to be based on _items instead of querying database.

Near future:
*1	Create
        -	online_performance:
		    -	format_id: FK to ~source
*2	Adjust postgres2postgres to insert rock.online_performance in order of insert_order,
    then, remove insert_order
*3	Remove:
        -	online_performance:
		    -	source_id
			-	play_order
			-	status
		-	todo
		-	config_daemon
		-	config_host_digital_format
		-	match_song*
		-	screen_stack
		-	search_result
		-	status

*	Change sendToPlayQueue() to return number of actual items queued:
    *	at SBIDSong: if spPtr->sendToPlayQueue() returns 0, find other items to play.
	*	repeat at all levels (SBIDSongPerformance, SBIDAlbumPerformance, SBIDOnlinePerformance)
*	Playlist should be able to contain songs, performances, record performances, online performances.
*	Find out where we need to offer a choice of what online performance to play if a song is to be played/queud.
*	After songs get assigned to playlist, need to refreshDependents() on the item assigned to the playlist.
*	search screen:
    -	need progress dialog
*	Open 'all songs' tab after 10s after showing opening screen.
*	Charts/Playlists to be minimized.

Import bugs/features/missing:
*	Look up record_performance by title, performer & title in addition to album position
*	Dialogbox needed at additional places during import
*	Validate album positions
*	Import songbase directory:
    *	Asks for N.w.a: too many choices offered
	*	The War On Drugs: one option is War On Drugs, The. This should be automatically accepted.
	*	Doobie Brothers: The Doobie Brothers
	*	It should not mix: The Specials and De Specials
	*	Album select: Greatest Hits by Boney M is a distinct different album than Greatest Hits by Elton John. Should be accepted automatically.
*	Create a table (and populate it) with most common Greatest Hits albums. MusicLibrary should just create a new album for this and not have the user select.
*	MusicLibrary:
    -	if an existing performer is selected, this performer needs to be shown when performances are chosen.
	-	if existing performance is selected, rock.performance gets inserted with role_id=0. Should be 1.
*	matchSongs: if matching on 'Down The Road (live)', should match on 'Down The Road'.
*	need to trim down list of alternatives shown for song
*	albumtitle from metadata not taken into account
*	Include feature to stop asking for user input during file import.
*   static SBIDPerformancePtr SBIDSong::selectPerformanceFromSong(SBIDSongPtr& songOnUnknownAlbumPtr, bool playableOnlyFlag);	//	CWIP: move to SBDIalogSelectItem
*	remove dots at start of any item (song, album, performer) when creating path

<SBIDAlbum edit>
*	may need to think about
	*	allowing multiple songs with the same positionID
	*	forget drag/drop of songs in album edit. With songs missing, it is impossible to determine new position:
		*	Use UI to assign new position IDs.
		*	Generate warnig if multiple songs with same position exist, allow to override
*	need to properly assign new albumPositions to *all* albumPerformances if one (or more) aP's get removed
*	if aP gets removed, need to set isDeletedFlag
*	if aP gets reordered, need to set isChangedFLag
*	need to somehow update SBIDManager when aP's are removed/inserted/changed. Maybe a simple reload will suffice (this reload will go to screenstack and handle screenItems that references removed items properly).
*	added online_performance_id to song table. This needs to be properly populated when online_performances for that song become available.

<bugs>
*	Any link between digital_format and formats maintained by songbase?
*	Postgres credentials are lost when creating new database
*	Creating new database does not make songbase switch to this database.
*	adding/removing from playlist: duration does not get updated
*	if it is not possible to connect to Postgres, need to see dialog box
*	if it is not possible to connect to Postgres, all credentials get wiped
*	Radio mode: sometimes song appears in list twice
*	Songs in Queue -- when at end of playlist, next song should start with 1st song.
*	remove SBID*::save() methods
*	support 24kb/s flac. See AudioDecoderFlac, search for _sampleFormat=paInt24;

<near future>
*	Redesign/larger font 'now playing' in player section.
*	Context: all classes to be instantiated here?
*	when done, each SBTab* class:
	*	review from where _init() should be called
*	if item is queued on empty playlist, auto start play
*	lot of garbage when queued gets populated. See if setting up view (hiding columns ed) can go to init (for all SBTab* classes)
	*	call postpopulate after loading 1 row as to avoid showing seemlingly random numbers
*	if new database is selected:
	*	stop music player
	*	context menu disappear from chooser (and possibly other places).
*	 radio mode: at end of 100th song, refill radio list (whether running to the end or skip to next song)
*	clear out 'shuffle' when less than 3 songs in queue.
*	when edit song, call SBIDSong::deleteIfOrphanized() for every performer performing that song.
*	Album: edit notes
*	Playlist: set sort order

*	addMissingDatabase objects: need a cleaner way (database dependent) to do this.
	*	DataAccessLayer::addMissingDatabaseItems() does not work on postgres.
	*	Progress box not be shown during this method.
*	(dis)appearing playbutton in front of any item in songlist
*	(dis)appearing playbutton in front of any item in playlist
*	Superclass SBTabAlbumEdit.AlbumEditModel and SBTabCurrentPlaylist.CurrentPlaylistModel
*	When changing performer on a song, ask if 1) if this is the only performer on the song (if this is the case,
	change *_performance to reflect this) or 2) if other performers perform this song. Only ask if there is only
	one performer on this song.
*	enable editing of notes in album
*	wil suggestion: create getID() and compareAttributes() in SBID* classes to explicitly force the use of these instead of compare operators.
	*	compare operators should be defined private
*	DataEntity::getDetail(): initialization of parameter to result should NOT happen.
*	Add option to playlist to always play in order or randomly.
*	SBID* classes: check on all executed database queries need to exists. SBAlbum::save() is example (calling SBMessageBox::databaseErrorMessageBox)
*	Open De Havenzangers -- www starts playing. Need to disable www tab as soon as we leave
*	SBIDManagerTemplate<T,parentT>::commitAll(): see if either multipe transactions can be nested or tell dal that we keep track of the transaction.

<future>
*	Support aac format (look at libav.org)
*	Put the loudspeaker icon in front of every view if the view has the current item playing.
*	Songs in Queue:
	*	reordering in Songs In Queue does not work: disabled for now (20160612)
	*	drag/drop only allowed to Chooser (other playlists).
*	Duration to be stored in seconds (or milliseconds) -> easier parsing.
*	Collect ID's of new songs and new performers saved so we can do proper rollback when user exits out
*	are song.notes, performance.notes used?
*	progress indicator should start before actual saving.
* 	performer, song tags
*	add wikipedia page for albums, songs in database
*	If artist is renamed from Simple Mind to Dire Straitz, URL should be blanked out.
*	If SBID.compareSimple() really needed?
*	Currently playing: disable scrollTo if user is navigating in current playlist (disable for x seconds)
*	Convert duration:timestamp to duration:duration: later if songbase(wwww) is withdrawn. Works fine with sqlite
*	only update last_played_date once after song has been listened to for 5s.
*	many places where toplay, online_performance records are deleted. Need to be merged to one place
*	playlists to consists of SBIDSong, SBIDPerformance, SBIDAlbumPerformance in addition to SBIDONlinePerformance

-	check when reordering playlist item on drag on itself.
-	charts
-	Updates to playlist, genres
-	redo dropdown for schemas when connected to songbase database
-	if no results in search, don't store in screenstack
-	tags on any item
-	about box
-	QCompleter:
	-	needs to be made context sensitive of playlist or genre selected.
	-	QCompleter items should be of <keyword>: <value>
		See comments in ScreenStack::applySonglistFilter()
-	cancel on open db when no db is found at runtime.
-	if genre changed, try to select genre that was changed (much later).
-	incorporate artist.sort_name in sorting -- not possible
-	LeftTreeView to be closable
* 	check: start playing right away (flac, windows). prevent scrolling beyond loaded area.
*	volume control
*	song detail should indicate which versions of which albums are available
*	loudspeaker icon wherever currently playing performance is displayed
*	drag own image at image e.g. for performer and use this
*	be smart about album duration. Populate albumPerformance.duration from actual music file as soon
    as the preferred_online_performance_id gets set/changed.
*	ability to pick MBID in case of multiple MBID's for the same performer (e.g. U2)
*	Set performance year based on album year if not set or -1
*	store MBID in database

Library check:
*	quite a number of songs without any performance
        select
		  s.song_id,
		  s.title,
		  r.title,
		  a.name
		FROM
		  rock.song s
		    JOIN rock.performance p USING (song_id)
			JOIN rock.artist a USING(artist_id)
			JOIN rock.record_performance rp USING(performance_id)
			JOIN rock.record r USING(record_id)

        WHERE
		    s.online_performance_id IS NULL
		ORDER BY a.name,r.title,s.title
