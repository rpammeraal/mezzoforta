	*	At that point, we can tell to a SBID instance: throw yourself in the queue, play yourself, etc.
*	Context: all classes to be instantiated here?
*	when done, each SBTab* class:
	*	review from where _init() should be called
*	if item is queued on empty playlist, auto start play
*	lot of garbage when queued gets populated. See if setting up view (hiding columns ed) can go to init (for all SBTab* classes)
	*	call postpopulate after loading 1 row as to avoid showing seemlingly random numbers
*	if new database is selected:
	*	stop music player
	*	context menu disappear from chooser (and possibly other places).
*	 radio mode: at end of 100th song, refill radio list (whether running to the end or skip to next song)
*	clear out 'shuffle' when less than 3 songs in queue.
*	when edit song, call SBIDSong::deleteIfOrphanized() for every performer performing that song.
*	add duration to album tab
*	Album: edit notes
*	Playlist: set sort order

*	addMissingDatabase objects: need a cleaner way (database dependent) to do this.
	*	DataAccessLayer::addMissingDatabaseItems() does not work on postgres.
	*	Progress box not be shown during this method.
*	(dis)appearing playbutton in front of any item in songlist
*	(dis)appearing playbutton in front of any item in playlist
*	Superclass SBTabAlbumEdit.AlbumEditModel and SBTabCurrentPlaylist.CurrentPlaylistModel
*	When changing performer on a song, ask if 1) if this is the only performer on the song (if this is the case,
	change *_performance to reflect this) or 2) if other performers perform this song. Only ask if there is only
	one performer on this song.
*	enable editing of notes in album
*	wil suggestion: create getID() and compareAttributes() in SBID* classes to explicitly force the use of these instead of compare operators.
	*	compare operators should be defined private
*	DataEntity::getDetail(): initialization of parameter to result should NOT happen.
*	Add option to playlist to always play in order or randomly.
*	SBID* classes: check on all executed database queries need to exists. SBAlbum::save() is example (calling SBMessageBox::databaseErrorMessageBox)

<future>
*	Support aac format (look at libav.org)
*	Put the loudspeaker icon in front of every view if the view has the current item playing.
*	Songs in Queue:
	*	reordering in Songs In Queue does not work: disabled for now (20160612)
	*	drag/drop only allowed to Chooser (other playlists).
*	Duration to be stored in seconds (or milliseconds) -> easier parsing.
*	Collect ID's of new songs and new performers saved so we can do proper rollback when user exits out
*	are song.notes, performance.notes used?
*	progress indicator should start before actual saving.
* 	performer, song tags
*	add wikipedia page for albums, songs in database
*	If artist is renamed from Simple Mind to Dire Straitz, URL should be blanked out.
*	If SBID.compareSimple() really needed?
*	Currently playing: disable scrollTo if user is navigating in current playlist (disable for x seconds)
*	Convert duration:timestamp to duration:duration: later if songbase(wwww) is withdrawn. Works fine with sqlite
*	only update last_played_date once after song has been listened to for 5s.

-	check when reordering playlist item on drag on itself.
-	charts
-	Updates to playlist, genres
-	redo dropdown for schemas when connected to songbase database
-	if no results in search, don't store in screenstack
-	tags on any item
-	about box
-	QCompleter:
	-	needs to be made context sensitive of playlist or genre selected.
	-	QCompleter items should be of <keyword>: <value>
		See comments in ScreenStack::applySonglistFilter()
-	cancel on open db when no db is found at runtime.
-	if genre changed, try to select genre that was changed (much later).
-	incorporate artist.sort_name in sorting -- not possible
-	LeftTreeView to be closable
* 	check: start playing right away (flac, windows). prevent scrolling beyond loaded area.
*	volume control
*	song detail should indicate which versions of which albums are available
